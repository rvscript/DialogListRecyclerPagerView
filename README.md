# DialogListRecyclerPagerView
A practice app that displays a listview, recyclerview, dialog view, pagerview, and more..
ListView is still common and can be made efficient by using the viewholder pattern. Yes, this is similar to RecyclerView but 
legacy code with listview still exists. This example uses the ViewHolder pattern to make a static class of the item views. It also 
recycles the views by checking if null in get view. Very efficient and with the logcat, you can see the size never increases
while scrolling. I created this example by following CodeTutor on youtube. Very good example that is worth practicing and sharing.
